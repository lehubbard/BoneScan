I forgot to write last weeks discussion post so I will include both.Last Week: I designed to proof of concept and researched some of the python libraries that it would depend on. I also configured my virtual environment that I would be developing in.This Week: I created a Github repo and developed the POC. I also created a logo for our product. I dedicated a substantial amount to time to learning how to package a python project. I believe this was a valuable use of time because any python developer should know the proper way to deploy the software they have developed.
